<p>
  This is a personal repository for posting my progress on building and programming the parralax bot bot. The purpose of this activity was to dive into the basics of electronics/circuits and to explore more       physical implementations of programming.

  Current Programs:
  <ul>
    <li>Simple Pin LEDs</li>
    <li>Square Turning</li>
    <li>Basic Driving</li>
    <li>Ramping</li>
    <li>EEPROM Instructions</li>
  </ul>
