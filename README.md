<p>
  This is a personal repository for posting my progress on building and programming the parralax boe bot. The purpose of this activity was to dive into the basics of electronics/circuits and to explore the more       physical implementations of programming. Using the STAMP Basic programs, I was able to experiment with LEDs, basic electronic components, and controlling servos/motors, along with understanding the use of Phototransmitters and Infrared Light detection. Throughout these programs, I learned about the basics of how electricity functions within circuits which included subjects such as voltage, amps, conventional flow vs electron flow, and Ohm's law. Overall, I enjoyed getting my hands dirty with more physical subjects that included programming and helped me bridge the gap between software and hardware functionality.

  Program Topics:
  <ul>
    <li>Simple Pin LEDs</li>
    <li>Square Turning</li>
    <li>Basic Driving</li>
    <li>Ramping</li>
    <li>EEPROM Instructions</li>
    <li>Phototransmitters</li>
    <li>Whisker Object Detection</li>
    <li>Infrared Light Detection</li>
  </ul>
